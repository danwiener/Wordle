# Wordle

.NET MAUI Wordle Game Created By Dan Wiener 1/2023. 

User has six guesses to correctly guess a randomly selected five letter word. User must input a real word in guessing the word chosen by the game, 
which will be verified by WORDSAPI. If user correctly guesses a letter that is present in the word-to-be=guessed, but the letter is in the wrong spot, 
it will be highlighted white. If user guesses the right letter in the correct spot, it will be highlighted green. Incorrect letters not present in the word 
will appear as is.
